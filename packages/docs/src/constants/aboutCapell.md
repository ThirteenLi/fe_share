# About Capell

## Background and Challenges of Capell

The rapid development of internet technology has greatly enhanced our lives' convenience and created new demands. However, traditional Content Delivery Network (CDN) services are facing pressing issues, including service disruptions due to reliance on single operators, poor service quality in remote areas due to distance from central nodes, and the high costs involved.

- **Service Disruptions**: Excessive reliance on single operators can lead to entire network service interruptions in the event of technical failures.
- **Poor Service Quality in Remote Areas**: Areas far from central nodes often experience poor service quality, affecting user experience.
- **High Costs**: The costs associated with maintaining traditional CDN networks are significant and may ultimately be passed on to end-users.

## Capell's Innovative Solution

Capell introduces a revolutionary approach by leveraging blockchain technology to establish a decentralized data network. This initiative directly addresses the core issues of traditional CDNs by incentivizing nodes through its own blockchain network and native tokens, thereby reducing costs and enhancing service availability and performance across the globe.

- **Decentralized Network**: By establishing a decentralized network, Capell eliminates reliance on single operators, enhancing network stability and reliability. [Why Capell](/intro/whycapell)
- **Token Incentives**：Capell rewards participants with native tokens for contributing bandwidth and computing resources, enhancing network service and availability. [Token Economics](https://alidocs.dingtalk.com/i/nodes/vy20BglGWOeDXxMEF9x9noXYJA7depqY?utm_scene=person_space)
- **Point Incentives**：Participants earn points for offering unused bandwidth, exchangeable for Capell's tokens, ensuring rewards regardless of usage. [Point System](/profit/points)
