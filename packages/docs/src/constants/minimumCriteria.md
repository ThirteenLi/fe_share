### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1. Can I use a cloud server instead of a physical machine?**  
No, cloud servers are not supported for this deployment. Due to specific requirements related to KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) support, our platform necessitates the use of physical servers. KVM provides a more secure and isolated environment necessary for the operations of our network, which cannot be adequately guaranteed by cloud servers at this time.
